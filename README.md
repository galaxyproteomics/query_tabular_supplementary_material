# Query Tabular Supplemental Material

The information in this repository contains the Supplemental Materials for the [F1000Rearch](https://f100research.com) paper _[Improve your Galaxy text life: The Query Tabular Tool](https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1604/)_.

The Query Tabular paper includes three use case demonstrations of the tool. Instructions and materials for each use case are provided and specified here in the folders: [proteogenomics](proteogenomics), [metaproteomics](metaproteomics), and [metabolomics](metabolomics).

Each folder contains a README file, a Galaxy workflow, and input history files for the workflow.

If you are running these use cases on your own Galaxy server see the README.md of each use case and verify that the correct version of all required tools are installed. Then upload each workflow through your Galaxy's `Workflow` tab. Finally, upload all input history files before following the README.md workflow instructions.
